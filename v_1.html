The summit of Mount Kaukau lies at an elevation of about 430 meters (1,411 ft) above sea level and offers scenic views of Wellington City and Wellington Harbour, the South Island, and the eastern hills. The city, harbour and the Remutaka and Tararua Ranges can be seen from the summit. On a clear day Mt. Tapuae-o-Uenuku and the Kaikoura Ranges in the South Island may be seen, whilst northwest is the Porirua Basin and the Tasman Sea.<br> <br>
    
The Mount Kaukau walk is the second walk after the Mount Victoria lookout walk, that I would recommend doing if you are short on time, but would still like to get some of the best views. It gives a good overview of many of the characteristic features of Wellington such as its hills, its harbor, views of the South Island, and views of wind turbines.

<h5>Real time weather conditions at the top of Mt Kaukau, compared to Khandallah</h5>
    
<p>
Summer may be the best season for good weather, but if you want to see snow on the Kaikoura Range on the South Island, which is visible from Mount Kaukau, winter or spring would be better. Just keep in mind that the ground can get slippery then.

While the initial part of the trail goes through a forest, the summit of Mount Kaukau is completely exposed to the elements, so the best time to walk up would be on a brilliantly sunny day with little to no wind. In addition, the trail can get muddy after a period of heavy rain, so if rain has fallen, wait a couple of days before you do the walk so that the trail can dry out a bit. 

Morning hours are good for light on the South Island and views to the west toward the top of the South Island. Afternoon hours are good for light on the city, the harbor, and the hills in the east.<br> <br> </p>  
    
<!-- Routes ------------------------------------------------------------>   
    
<h2 id="routes">Getting there</h2>
    
    <p>Much of the eastern 'city side' slopes of Mount Kaukau make up Khandallah Park, which is one of the oldest parks in New Zealand, established in 1888 and then registered as a domain in 1909.[3] Khandallah Park has more than 60 hectares of native forest. Native birds such as the kereru, tui and fantail are common sights when walking through the native forest. Stumps of the old totara trees can also be seen walking through the first lower parts of the forest.Mount Kaukau forms part of the Northern Skyline track from Johnsonville to Karori and Makara.<br><br>

<h5>Clark St entrance / route up to Mt Kaukau summit</h5>
<p>Trail length:	3.3 km (2 mi) return from the entrance on Simla Crescent in Khandallah. <br>
Walking time:	1 hour 10 minutes return <br>
Difficulty:	Medium to hard <br>
Trail type:	Gravel and dirt trail that goes through bush up a hill. There are steps in some places to make it easier to get up the hill. <br>
Trail condition:	Good and well maintained but can get muddy or slippery after periods of heavy rain. <br>
Fitness level:	Moderate to high. There are many steps to walk up and the trail can be steep in some parts, but in general, the walk provides a good mixture of steps, gravel, and sections that are not too steep. You can certainly get a good workout when walking up Mount Kaukau, and that is exactly why locals walk or run up the hill.

<h5>Scenic views from the top of Mt Kaukau</h5>
<p>
"I love the views once you reach the top of Mount Kaukau. This is a steep, uphill walk up a number of steps but will take you less than 1 hour. A great walk for a city lighting the great variety and diversity in Wellington city."
    
"Mt Kaukau offers splendid 360 degree views near Wellington.
A climb to the 445m summit takes around 45 minutes at a reasonable pace and is well worth the effort!
From the top, one is greeted with views of the sparkling harbour, the wind turbines to the west and the surrounding hillside.
From the summit there are options to continue North to Johnsonville or South along the Skyline walkway that could take you as far as Karori.
Very highly recommended and well worth an adventure!"
